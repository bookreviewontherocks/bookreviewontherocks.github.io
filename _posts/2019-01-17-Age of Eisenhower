The Age of Eisenhower: America and the World in the 1950s
By William Hitchcock

This work focuses on Eisenhower's eight years as president. It is sweeping in its scope and diligent in its treatment of the various aspects of the period. It covers military, economic, civil rights, and judicial facets of life during Eisenhower's Presidency. Probably the best single volume discussion of Eisenhower's presidency. 


# Review


## Prologue
- Eisenhower shaped the US in three ways

   - Dramatically expanded the power and scope of 20th century warfare state and put into place a long-term strategy designed to war, and win, the cold war.
   - He recast domestic politics by strengthening a national consensus about the place of government in the lives of American citizens. 
   - He created a distinctive model of presidential leadership that Americans -- now more than ever-- ought to study…. 
- He believed that discipline was the key to success. 
- Eisenhower brought Americans together and thought it was necessary for a country to sacrifice in order to succeed. He wanted Americans to know that they had to work hard in order to benefit and that the government’s job was to clear the path. He discussed what the nation needed from injured veterans from the Korean War on the deck of the presidential yacht that Eisenhower decommissioned. He told them that their country needed them to continue to sacrifice in order to be examples for others not to focus on what they would get but what they could continue to give.
 
## Part I Duty
### Ch 1 Ascent
- Eisenhower struggled in his career, he did not get to fight in WWI and thought that this meant the end of whatever chance he had to attain high rank. He had the good fortune of finding some mentors, Fox Conner whom he met through George Patton. Conner helped Eisenhower study and was able to shepard him through to critical assignments that allowed Eisenhower to get away from the assumption that he was a really good football coach but not a great officer. 
- With WWII, Eisenhower was able to capitalize on his capabilities as a leader and planner. Marshall, yet another mentor, saw his potential and put him in charge of getting the US effort going in London. This led to the command of force in North Africa, Italy, and finally as supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe.
Eisenhower’s role as supreme commander required him to face severe challenges. He had to balance the political and military aspects many of which were outside of his immediate influence. He had to keep a cool head in order to maintain a focus on what was important and he did so in an outstanding manner. 
### Ch 2 Star Power
- Eisenhower struggled in the post-war environment because he was unwilling to gladly go along with the dismantling of the military. He knew what it took to create this war machine and he worried that the country was going along without really understanding the consequences of their decision.
- Eisenhower’s friends were powerful and Republican. They offered entrance into a great world of privilege but he offered them access to real power through Eisenhower’s political potential.
### Ch 3 call to duty
- The Korean War began in the summer of 1950 and called for an increase in the national defense of the US. This included increasing European military forces. Truman called Eisenhower to command the new NATO forces. - - - Meanwhile, Eisenhower’s friends continued to press him to run for election.
- Eisenhower’s friends worked to recruit him but Eisenhower did not want to campaign. He did not tell them not to try to draft him but for a long time he refused to discuss the actual campaign. As it became clear that he had to campaign in order to win, he reluctantly asked to be relieved and started to contemplate his political life. 
### Ch 4 Crusade
- His winning of the nomination at the convention came about on the first ballot, after some delegates switched from their states’ favorite son to Eisenhower. 
- Eisenhower picked Nixon to be his vice president as a way to provide some defense against the any attack of Eisenhower as not being strongly anti-communist. Also, Nixon, from California, could provide some support in the West, where Eisenhower was weak.
- Eisenhower was an effective campaigner and he was not the inexperienced neophyte that many claim he was. 
He won the election but it was not a clean race on either side. 
## Part II
### Ch 5 Scorpions in a Bottle
- As president, Eisenhower did not believe that the Soviets were looking for a way to defuse or thaw in the cold war. Churchill thought that the death of Stalin offered some opportunity for a change in course but Eisenhower disagreed. 
- Eisenhower did propose “Atoms for Peace” however, this was not a disarmament proposal it was simply an offer to expand nuclear technology to a peaceful purpose. 
### Ch 6 Confronting McCarthy.
- Eisenhower was on the defensive against McCarthy. His administration was not against communist hunting or even using the process to destroy innocent people. It was against the public manner of McCarthy and the way that the senator attacked the administration. 
- It came to a head when evidence that McCarthy and his legal advisor Roy Cohn pressured the Army to give Schine preferential treatment because Schine was a friend of Cohn’s. 
- Eisenhower was tough on communism and he was not above destroying someone based on their political ideas that were then out of fashion. Oppenheimer is an example of this. The president did not worry that Oppenheimer was a patriot and was loyal to his country or that Oppenheimer’s objections to the hydrogen bomb were out of a deep moral conviction. These ideas were dangerous because they cut against the grain of what was acceptable, not illegal, at the time. 
### Ch 7 Dark Arts for a Cold War
- Allen Dulles was Eisenhower’s top spy as leader of the CIA. He transformed the agency into a more focused covert operation at the risk of reducing the concentration on intelligence gathering. 
- The Iranian and Guatemalan coups were problematic because they targeted regimes that were not communist but were suspect. He argues that Dulles’ focus on these operations detracted from the real work of the CIA and Eisenhower, as a reaction, looked to technical experts to help guide national defense policy.
- One of the troubling trends the author identifies was the increasingly opaque methods Eisenhower used in his foreign policy. This was in contradiction to the rhetoric that Eisenhower deployed concerning American values of transparency and democracy. Congress could not provide oversight of these covert actions and this removed them from the ability of the people to influence them. 
### Ch 8 Asian Dominoes
- Eisenhower faced with the problem of the French fall in Indochina did not rush to help them out. He did not want to replace French colonialism with American colonialism. Although his actions spoke to his desire to deter and remain outside of direct conflict, his rhetoric was very different. His rhetoric voiced the need to not let Indochina fall and the dire threat that such an event entailed. 
- Taiwan, specifically the islands of Quemoy and Matsu were very different. Eisenhower looked at this as an act of hostility from China against a US ally and this made it easier to garner Congressional and executive branch support to stop. 
### Ch 9 Taking on Jim Crow
- The problem that Eisenhower faced concerning civil rights was that he did not want to push too hard too fast because it risked too much backlash. He was unfamiliar with the problems that African Americans faced in the South and did not really understand their life. He lived in a segregated society and did not see the urgency but knew that risks that aggressive action invited. 
- Eisenhower was more willing to allow progress to develop organically, he did not push for it but he did not stop it either. 
### Ch 10 God, Government, and the Middle Way
- Eisenhower was part of a national revival in religion. He was openly religious and exhorted Americans to return to church. He was not doctrinaire about what religion  people practiced but only that they did so. He thought that this was an act of resistance to communism and was powerful in and of itself. 
- He also understood after the midterm election of 1054 that his party had to find a better way to approach national problems. It was not enough to talk about small government, his party had to have solutions for government. He was not advocating becoming a big government party but he did not think it was wise to refuse any role for the national government. 
### Ch 11 To the Summit
- Eisenhower went the Geneva summit to meet with the leaders of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Some hoped it would bring about a fundamental change in the cold war. However, Eisenhower, did not think that this was possible. 
- Nothing came of summit. 
- He had a heart attack in Denver while on vacation in 1955. This caused much speculation about whether or not he would serve
### Ch 12 A Formidable Indifference
- Eisenhower continued to push for his middle way but that became more difficult as issues like civil rights came to the fore. 
- He did not want to push too rapidly yet it was also clear that the nation needed clear leadership on this issue. 
- Eisenhower easily won the GOP nomination and he was now the clear leader of the party and helped set its platform for the 1956 election. 
### Ch 13 Double Cross at Suez
- Eisenhower did not want to get drawn into a colonial war in support of European powers in Suez. 
- This was a point of contention since Eisenhower saw Britain and France as leading the charge to continue their oppression of African countries. Eisenhower wanted to make it clear that the US did not support these designs but he had to maintain some affinity with the British and French. However, he would not support them to point of using force.
- The Eisenhower doctrine was that the US would not allow the Soviets to expand their control. However, it was rather unclear exactly how Eisenhower would make sure that this did not happen.
## Part III Race, Rockets, and Revolution
### Ch 14 The Color Line
- Eisenhower did not want to make more problems out of the civil rights issue. He thought that the Court had spoken about desegregation in Brown v BOE but he did not want to aggressively pursue the enforcement of this ruling. 
- However, events forced his hand. In Little Rock, the governor of Arkansas did not allow integration to continue. A federal district court ordered him to allow this but he again refused. He used the national guard to prevent the admission of the black students. Eisenhower had to act not because he wanted to enforce the court order but because he thought he could not allow the governor to flaunt federal authority.
### Ch 15 Ike’s Missile Crisis
- Eisenhower was caught sort of flat-footed about the USSR missile capability. The USSR was making great strides by 1957 and publicly the problem was that the US progress was largely secret. The launch of the Soviet satellite seemed to show the problems of the US approach and the success of the Soviets. While this was true to an extent, - Eisenhower did decide to focus on missiles in 1955 as a result of the Killian committee findings and this started to bear fruit by the end of 1957. 
1957 was the toughest year for Eisenhower because of his health problems and the foreign policy problems that he had to wrestle with. These made his domestic critics more energetic and many wondered about his ability to lead the nation during this turbulent time. 
- Eisenhower’s critics made much of the problems that the nation faced in 1958. There was indecision on the foreign front in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific. Eisenhower’s patience paid off but that was difficult to see in the near term. At home, there was struggling economy that made his brand of small government seem out of touch with what was going on in the country. Eisenhower’s party lost much in the mid term elections and this made it more difficult for him politically. 
### Ch 16 Contending with Khrushchev
- Khrushchev wanted to get a summit meeting with Eisenhower and Eisenhower needed a way to rebuild his political capital after his devastating congressional losses in 1958. Khrushchev gave the Western powers six months to come to an agreement with East Germany and leave Berlin but he moved away from that deadline when Harold - MacMillan came to Moscow for a meeting. Although the meeting was contentious it did end well with MacMillan being able to come home and tout his progress in lessening the anxiety over Berlin.
- Nixon’s visit to Moscow was a chance for him to make a name for himself as a statesman. He did well in showing resolve and handling the Soviet premier well. 
- Although Eisenhower’s push to lessen the tensions of the Cold War with Khrushchev did not amount to much officially it was successful. Eisenhower was able to change the terms of the conflict and helped ensure that it remained an economic and not a military competition. 
### Ch 17 Secret Wars in the Third World
- Eisenhower looked to covert operations as a way to continue to stop the growth of communism while maintaining a low level of tension. The problem, according to the author, is that these were counterproductive measures and ended up causing more problems than they solved.  
### Ch 18 U-2
- The intelligence that the U-2 provided was invaluable for Eisenhower to understand Soviet capability. However, he did not want to risk his peace overtures to the Soviets because of this. Eisenhower wanted to wait on the - Corona satellite but his intelligence advisors pressured him to reconsider. 
- Eisenhower gave in because of the value of the intelligence and the fact that it allowed his administration to be more clear in their defense of his policies, which his opponents claimed was soft and ill-informed on the dangers that the Soviets posed. 
- The downed U-2 plane gave ammunition to Khrushchev who used it to sabotage the Paris summit. Khrushchev wanted to give Eisenhower and out and have the president blame someone else for the decision to authorize the overflight but Eisenhower refused. 
### Ch 19 Fighting to the Finish
- Eisenhower did want Nixon to lose to Kennedy but he was also unsure of how effective Nixon would be as president. Eisenhower did not like or trust Nixon and this made it difficult for the president to campaign for him. 
- Nixon was also the author of his own defeat, he was not effective in debates and had a negative campaign message that did not compare well with the positive one that Kennedy ran on. 
### Ch 20 A New Generation
- Eisenhower’s presidency was not well received by many who lived through it. However, his capabilities as a leader and president only rose in estimation as the decades passed. 
- Eisenhower was keenly able to grow the economy, maintain fiscal restraint, and keep the US out of problematic conflicts. This was no easy task and was a testament to his presidential leadership.
