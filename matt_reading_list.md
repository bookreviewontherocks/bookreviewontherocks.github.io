# History

## Roman Empire

__[Death Throes of the Republic Series (HH)](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-death-throes-of-the-republic-series/) by Dan Carlin [Podcast]__ \
Focuses on the transition between Republic and Empire

__[History of Rome] (https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) by Mike Duncan [Podcast]__ \
With +150 episodes, to say it's comprehensive would be an understatement 



## American Revolution and Early Days of the Democracy

__Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow__ \
I won't throw away my shot!  A bit long but very detailed.

__Six Frigates by Ian Toll__ \
Covers War of 1812 and America shortly after it's founding.

__[The American Revolution from Yale Open Course](https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-116) [Podcast]__ \
More of an academic take on it.  

__1776 by David McCullough__ \
Focuses just on the first year of the war.

__Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer__ \
Long time since i read this but i recall it was pretty enjoyable

__How to Hide and Empire by Daniel Immerwahr__ \
While the key thesis of the book is that we have never properly acknowledged our territories or empirical past, covers a lot of the early history up to WWI / WWII. 

## World War I
__The Guns of August by Barbara W. Tuchman__ \
Discusses the key month of August as WWI began.  Incredible book.

__[Blueprint for Armageddon (HH)](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/) [Podast]__ \
Awesome treatment of the entire conflict.

## Interwar Years (Prior to US Involvement)
__In the Garden of Beasts by Erik Larson__ \
Insight into pre-war, Nazi germany from the point of view of the American Ambassador and his family.  A bit dry due to all the detail, but fascinating.


## World War II
__Rise and Fall of the Third Riech by William L. Shirer__ \
Start here for the European theater.  Truely amazing book. 

__[Ghosts of the Ostfront Series (HH)](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-ghosts-ostfront-series/) [Podast]__ \
Covers the uber important Eastern front.  Really, this is where the war took place but because we are westerner we only really hear about the Western Front against France/England.

__Pacific Crucible and the Pacific Trilogy by Ian Toll__ \
Three books, the third comes out mid-2019.  Outstanding retelling of the Pacific Theater.  

__Casablanca [Movie]__ \
When watching this, it's important to understand that this move comes out in 1942 a year after the attack on Perl Harbor.  So, there is no 'happy ending' yet assured for the allied forces.  Story is that the French refugees portrayed in the movie are also actual French refugees.  So, when they play  Le Marseillaise in the movie those tears in the actors eye are real and earnest.

__Sound of Music [Movie]__ \
Occurs during the Anschluss.  Gives you a sense of how odd it must have been to be an Austrian in that time.

__Kings Speech [Movie]__ \
Covers political situation in England before the war.  An interesting personal story of the King colored strongly by the gravity of WWII.

__Patton [Movie]__ \
Story of a Key American General.  An interesting character in history.  He shares this quality of being 'destine' for WWII much like Churchill.

## Cold War
__13 Days [Movie]__ \
Recreationg of the political drama going on during the Cuban Missile Crisis

__Dr Stranglove [Movie]__ \
Speaks to the insanity of the time.

__Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 by Michael R. Beschloss [Audiobook]__ \
Audio book recommended as you get to hear the actual tape recordings.

__Charlie Wilson's War by George Crile__ \
Skip the movie which was just okay.  The book is great and covers to Russian conflict in Afghanistan and our proxy war.  You read this and you shake your head and wonder why we made the same mistake the Russians did.

## Space Race
__The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe__ \
The Story of the early Astronauts.

__From Earth to the Moon [TV Series]__ \
Reenactment of the US efforts in the space race.

The 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of a few short sellers.

__Flash Boys by Michael Lewis__ \
Story of high frequency trading.  You'll want to punch someone.

__Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis__ \
Talks about Lewis experiences as a bond salesmen on Wall Street in the 1980s.  I need to reread this...he was a Salomon Brothers as a bond trader which means he could have crossed paths with John Meriwether who went on to found Long Term Capital Management.

__When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein__ \
Story of Long Term Capital Management.

__The Physics of Wall Street by James Owen Weatherall__ \
Talks about the math folks have used to try and beat the market.
